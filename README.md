# Password-Generator
A simple password generator made in python, feel free to use it
in order to run this program properly, you need to run it from a terminal (Powershell, iTerm, Linux Terminal, etc). I don't recomand running it by double clicking. When you run your program, a password will automaticly be generated. Hope you found this useful.
